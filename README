To get StockWatch running:

Modify the InstallStockWatch.py file to match your directory

i.e.
inst = installer.Installer('/absolute/path/to/StockWatch/', '/absolute/path/to/raw_data/', earliest_year_you_want_in_your_data_folder)

Then run this with

python InstallStockWatch.py

It has some basic error catching.

Then get it running with supervisord

When it is running, it will check the file watch_list.csv for stocks that you are interested in, then update the eod data regularly
If it detects a signal of interest, it will produce a pop up notification with a price chart


supervisor.conf needs to be placed in one of these:

/usr/local/share/supervisor/supervisord.conf
Other options are
/usr/local/share/etc/supervisord.conf
/usr/local/share/supervisord.conf

to start StockWatch with supervisord use:
supervisord -c /usr/local/share/supervisor/supervisord.conf
or the path to where you stored it

TODO: Integrate this into the install procedure
